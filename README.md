- 👋 Hi, I’m @icarus-00 you can call me icarus.
- 👀 I’m a person of many hobbies, cooking, sketching, sewing, wood crafts, and the list goes on.
- as the name implies, I flew too close to the sun, many times, with questions that takes me off the track
- that i start learning in fields not meant in physics, chemistry, philosophy and biology
- but aside from all that I’m currently learning computer science, also in many fields.
- in college i learn information security and digital forensics, and personally i learn about game development and apps and web design and programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects, ui/ux projects and anything related to desktop development (games, systems, etc) not on mobile thought.
- i am hard to reach by now as i have many accounts that i can't keep track of, but once that done i'll update this page with something.
- for now you can email me at justademo@skiff.com
- hace a nice day <3
